    <h1>package:pretty</h1>
    <p>
      The <code>pretty</code> package exports one class: <code>Document</code>.
      A document can be seen as a set of different layouts for the same text.
      Calling <code>render(n)</code> on a document picks
      the best of its layouts that fit in <code>n</code> columns.
    </p>
    <code class="dart">doc.render(80); // tries to fit doc in 80 columns</code>
    <p>
      It is returned as a string. There's also an efficient
      <code>renderToSink</code> method if needed.
    </p>
    <p>
      There aren't many ways to create a document. Namely, a document has
      one of the following forms:
    </p>
    <pre><code class="hljs">empty
line
text(str)
doc + doc
doc.nest(n)
doc.group</code></pre>
    <p>Informally,</p>
    <ul>
      <li><code>empty</code> is the empty document</li>
      <li><code>line</code> is a new line</li>
      <li><code>text(str)</code> is the text <code>str</code></li>
      <li><code>doc1 + doc2</code> is <code>doc1</code> concatenated to <code>doc2</code></li>
      <li><code>doc.nest(n)</code> is <code>doc</code> where every new line is indented by <code>n</code> spaces</li>
      <li><code>doc.group</code> is <code>doc</code> where line breaks are allowed to render as <code>" "</code> instead</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The rest of this document illustrates these forms with interactive
      examples of increasing complexity.
    </p>

    <h2>Preliminaries</h2>
    <p>
      We start by defining four text documents that will be used throughout the
      examples.
    </p>
    <pre><code class="dart">Document a = text("aaa");
Document b = text("bbb");
Document c = text("ccc");
Document d = text("ddd");</code></pre>
    <p>
      Remember that <code>Document</code>s are immutable so it's safe to reuse
      them. For instance, we can can create a document that renders as
      <code>"aaaaaa"</code> by concatenating <code>a</code> with itself.
    </p>
    <pre><code class="dart">a + a</code></pre>

    <h2>Basic forms</h2>
    <p>
      <code>text</code>, <code>empty</code>, <code>line</code>
      and <code>+</code> are pretty self-explanatory and don't need much
      introduction. Let's just note that <code>+</code> is associative, that
      <code>empty</code> is neutral for <code>+</code> and that
      <code>line</code> is equivalent to <code>text("\n")</code> as long as
      <code>nest</code> and <code>group</code> aren't involved.
    </p>
    <p>As an example, here is a Dart expression using these combinators:</p>
    <code class="dart">a + empty + b + line + c</code>
    <p>And here is how it renders:</p>
    <pretty-viewer id="plus-demo" config={{plusConfig}}></pretty-viewer>
    <p>
      The red line can be moved to adjust the desired maximum number of columns
      but it won't have any effect on this document since it doesn't use
      <code>group</code>. The + and - minus buttons change the font size.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note that this document is equivalent to any parenthezising of the
      original expression, e.g. <code>(a + empty) + (b + (line + c))</code>.
      It is also equivalent to <code>a + b + line + c</code>.
    </p>

    <h2>Nesting</h2>
    <p>
      The method <code>nest</code> indents all lines after a line break inside
      the document it applies to. For instance the following document:
    </p>
    <code class="dart">a + (line + b + line + c).nest(2) + line + d</code>
    <p>
      renders as follows:
    </p>
    <pretty-viewer id="nest-demo-1" config={{nestConfig1}}></pretty-viewer>
    <p>
      Here, <code>nest</code> applies to the two occurrences of
      <code>line</code>s inside the parenthesis, but not to the one outside,
      as is made clear by the structure of the expression. Note that the
      following document renders exactly the same:
    </p>
    <code class="dart">(a + line + b + line + c).nest(2) + line + d</code>
    <p>
      In both cases, <code>nest</code> only affects lines appearing
      <i>after</i> a line break.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nesting is compositional: a document with a nested subdocument can in
      turn be nested as part of a bigger document. For example the following
      document:
    </p>
    <code class="dart">a + (line + b + (line + c).nest(2) + line + d).nest(2)</code>
    <p>
      renders as follows:
    </p>
    <pretty-viewer id="nest-demo-2" config={{nestConfig2}}></pretty-viewer>
    <p>
      This document is still "static": the desired number of columns has no
      effect on the rendering. Yet it demonstrate one interesting aspect of the
      library already: documents can be composed without having to worry
      about any global indentation level. This makes it easy to write
      composable pretty-printing functions.
    </p>
    <h2>Grouping</h2>
    <p>
    The method <code>group</code> is what makes documents "responsive": it
    tells the renderer when it is OK to <i>not</i> render a <code>line</code> as
    a line break, but as a space instead. Depending on the available amount of
    horizontal space, the renderer will decide for each group whether it is
    better flattened or not.
    </p>
    <p>For instance the following expression:</p>
    <code class="dart">(a + line + (b + line + c).group + line + d).group</code>
    <p>renders as follows:</p>
    <pretty-viewer id="group-demo-1" config={{groupConfig1}}></pretty-viewer>
    <p>
      Moving the red line with the mouse reveals the effect of
      <code>group</code>. As long as enough horizontal space is available, the
      outer group (and <i>a fortiori</i> the inner group) is flattened and all
      occurrences of <code>line</code> are replaced by spaces. When less than 15
      columns are available, the outer group stops being flattened but the inner
      group still fits on one line. For 8 columns or less, all occurrences of
      <code>line</code> translate to line breaks.
    <p>
    <p>
      Note that <code>group</code> integrates seamlessly with <code>nest</code>:
      flatten groups ignore nesting altogether since there is no line break.
      Otherwise, nesting applies as usual. For instance the following
      expression:
    </p>
    <code class="dart">(a + (line + (b + line + c).group).nest(2) + line + d).group</code>
    <p>renders as follows:</p>
    <pretty-viewer id="group-demo-2" config={{groupConfig2}}></pretty-viewer>
    <p>
      As long as 15 colums or more are available, the document renders as
      before. But as soon as the outer group breaks, the nesting becomes
      apparent.
    <h2>Pretty-Printing Trees</h2>
    <p>
      Let us now apply the libtary to a full-fledged example: a pretty-printer
      of rose trees. We define trees as follows.
    </p>
    <pre><code class="dart">class Tree {
  final String name;
  final List&lt;Tree&gt; children;

  Tree(this.name, this.children);
}</code></pre>
    <p>
      We want pretty-printed trees to look something like:
    </p>
    <code class="hljs">foo { bar, baz { qux, bar }, baz }</code>
    <p>
      We pretty-print a tree by prepending its name to its
      pretty-printed children, and then group the result:
    </p>
    <pre><code class="dart">Document prettyTree(Tree tree) {
  final prettyChildren = /* TODO */
  return (text(tree.name) + prettyChildren).group;
}</code></pre>
    <p>
      If <code>tree</code> has no children then <code>prettyChildren</code> is
      the empty document. Otherwise it will have something to do with
      <code>prettyTree</code> mapped over <code>tree.children</code>:
    </p>
    <pre><code class="dart">final prettyChildren = tree.children.isEmpty
    ? empty
    : /* SOMETHING SOMETHING tree.children.map(prettyTree) */;</code></pre>
    <p>
      In order to flesh out this something, we start by defining an auxiliary
      function that puts curly braces around a document and indents it by 2
      spaces.
    </p>
    <pre><code class="dart">Document brackets(Document doc) {
  return (text(" {") + line + doc).nest(2) + line + text("}");
}</code></pre>
    <p>
      We will apply it to the result of gluing the pretty-printed subtrees
      together.
    </p>
    <pre><code class="dart">final prettyChildren = tree.children.isEmpty
    ? empty
    : brackets(/* tree.children.map(prettyTree) GLUED TOGETHER */);</code></pre>
    <p>
      There is actually a facility method just for that in the
      <code>Document</code> class: <code>join</code>.
      The expression <code>doc.join([doc1, ..., docn])</code> is equivalent to
      <code>doc1 + doc + ... + doc + docn</code>. In our case, we want to join
      the prettified children with a comma followed by a line break.
    </p>
    <pre><code class="dart">final prettyChildren = tree.children.isEmpty
    ? empty
    : brackets((text(",") + line).join(tree.children.map(prettyTree)));</code></pre>
    <p>
      Finally, the full pretty-printing code is reproduced below.
    </p>
    <pre><code class="dart">Document prettyTree(Tree tree) {
  final prettyChildren = tree.children.isEmpty
      ? empty
      : brackets((text(",") + line).join(tree.children.map(prettyTree)));
  return (text(tree.name) + prettyChildren).group;
}

Document brackets(Document doc) {
  return (text(" {") + line + doc).nest(2) + line + text("}");
}</code></pre>
    <p>And here is how it renders on a random tree:</p>
    <pretty-viewer id="tree-demo" config={{treeConfig}}></pretty-viewer>
    <p>The reload button generates a new random tree.</p>

    <h2>Pretty-Printing JSON</h2>
    <p>
      Finally, let us write a "real world" pretty-printer: a pretty-printer
      of JSON documents. JSON document being trees, it will be very similar to
      the pretty-printer of the previous section.
    </p>
    <p>
      The only novelty is the usage of a not yet introduced function:
      <code>lineOr</code>. The expression <code>lineOr(str)</code> renders as
      <code>str</code> if there is enough horizontal space, as a line break
      otherwise. It is a generalisation of <code>line</code>, which is actually
      a shortcut for <code>lineOr(" ")</code>. Since we want empty JSON objects
      to render as <code>{}</code> and not as <code>{ }</code>, yet to break
      after the first brace if required, we use <code>lineOr("")</code>
      instead of <code>line</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Other than that the code, reproduced below, is unsurprising.
    </p>

    <pre><code class="dart">Document comma = text(",") + line;

Document between(String left, String right, Document doc) {
  return (text(left) + (lineOr('') + doc).nest(2) + lineOr('') + text(right)).group;
}

Document prettyJson(Object json) {
  if (json is List) {
    return between("[", "]", comma.join(json.map(prettyJson)));
  } else if (json is Map) {
    final children = [];
    json.forEach((key, value) {
      children.add(escape(key) + text(": ") + prettyJson(value));
    });
    return between("{", "}", comma.join(children));
  } else {
    return escape(json);
  }
}

Document escape(Object leaf) {
  return text(const JsonEncoder().convert(leaf));
}</code></pre>
    <p>And here is how it renders on a random JSON document:</p>
    <pretty-viewer id="json-demo" config={{jsonConfig}}></pretty-viewer>
    <p>That is all there is to the pretty library. Enjoy!</p>
